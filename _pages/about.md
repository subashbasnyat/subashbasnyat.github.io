I am a Computer Engineer graduated from Kathmandu University, Nepal. The existence is a program, we are here to add our part of code.


As Paul Lockhart said in The Mathematician’s Lament,
> We are all born into this world, and at some point we will die and that will be that. In the meantime, let’s enjoy our minds and the wonderful and ridiculous things we can do with them. I don’t know about you, but I’m here to have fun.
